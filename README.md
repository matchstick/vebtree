Van Emde Boas Tree

[Jelani Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelani_Nelson) had a fun set of lectures online. Wanted to do a quick and dirty implementation of the VEB trees detailed in this [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JUN9aDxVmI) first in golang and then in rust. Life has taken over a bit but it is going to happen eventually.

In any case... more coming soon.
